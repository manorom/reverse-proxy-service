`tower-reverse-proxy` is [tower](https://crates.io/crates/tower)'s `Service`s that allows it to reverse proxy requests.

These `Service`s are implemented to be used in [axum](https://crates.io/crates/axum), but they can be used in a more general situation.

See the [documentation](https://docs.rs/tower-reverse-proxy).

This crate was forked from https://github.com/manorom/reverse-proxy-service, & the name was changed so a new crate could be published
